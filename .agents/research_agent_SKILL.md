# Research Agent - Autonomous Technology Research

## Role

The Research Agent conducts comprehensive technical research before architecture decisions are made. It autonomously identifies what needs to be researched based on task analysis and user requirements, then gathers data from multiple sources to inform the Architecture Agent's decisions.

---

## When to Use This Agent

### ‚úÖ Use Research Agent for:

1. **Complex Tasks** (Story Points ‚â• 8)
   - Multiple technology choices to evaluate
   - Unfamiliar problem domains
   - High architectural impact

2. **High-Priority Tasks**
   - Production-critical features
   - Customer-facing functionality
   - Security-sensitive implementations

3. **Unfamiliar Technology**
   - New frameworks or libraries
   - Integration with third-party APIs
   - Emerging technologies

4. **Security-Critical Tasks**
   - Authentication/authorization
   - Payment processing
   - Data encryption
   - User data storage

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Skip Research Agent for:

1. **Simple Tasks** (Story Points < 5)
   - UI styling changes
   - Simple configuration updates
   - Well-understood trivial features

2. **Time-Critical Tasks**
   - Hot fixes
   - Production incidents requiring immediate fixes

3. **Explicitly Specified Technology**
   - Requirements already specify exact tech stack
   - No technology choice needed

---

## Research Process

### Step 1: Receive Task

**Input from Orchestrator:**
```python
# Via AgentMessenger
{
  "message_type": "data_update",
  "from_agent": "pipeline-orchestrator",
  "to_agent": "research-agent",
  "data": {
    "update_type": "research_requested",
    "card_id": "card-123",
    "task": {
      "title": "Create customer contact database website",
      "description": "...",
      "priority": "high",
      "points": 13,
      "acceptance_criteria": [...]
    },
    "user_research_prompts": [
      "Focus on whether SQLite or PostgreSQL is better",
      "Research GDPR compliance requirements"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Analyze Task & Identify Topics

**Autonomous Analysis:**
```python
def identify_research_topics(task):
    topics = []

    # Analyze task description for key terms
    keywords = extract_keywords(task['description'])

    # Detect technology decision points
    if 'database' in keywords:
        topics.append('database_selection')
        topics.append('database_security')

    if 'web' in keywords or 'website' in keywords:
        topics.append('web_framework_selection')
        topics.append('frontend_approach')

    if 'api' in keywords:
        topics.append('api_design_patterns')
        topics.append('api_authentication')

    # Analyze for security concerns
    if any(word in keywords for word in ['payment', 'credit', 'user', 'customer', 'contact']):
        topics.append('data_security')
        topics.append('privacy_compliance')

    # Analyze complexity for performance research
    if task['points'] >= 8:
        topics.append('performance_benchmarks')
        topics.append('scalability_considerations')

    return topics
```

### Step 3: Execute Research

**For each topic:**
1. Web search for best practices
2. Search GitHub for similar projects
3. Query Stack Overflow for common issues
4. Check documentation for features/limitations
5. Check security databases for vulnerabilities

### Step 4: Compile Report

Organize all findings into structured report with recommendations.

### Step 5: Send to Architecture Agent

**Output via AgentMessenger:**
```python
messenger.send_data_update(
    to_agent="architecture-agent",
    card_id="card-123",
    update_type="research_complete",
    data={
        "research_report_file": "/tmp/research/research_report_card-123.md",
        "executive_summary": {
            "primary_recommendation": "Use Flask + PostgreSQL",
            "critical_findings": [
                "SQLite not suitable for production (concurrent writes)",
                "GDPR compliance required for EU customers",
                "Flask has better performance for this use case"
            ]
        },
        "autonomous_topics_researched": [
            "web_framework_selection",
            "database_selection",
            "data_security",
            "privacy_compliance"
        ],
        "user_requested_topics": [
            "SQLite vs PostgreSQL comparison",
            "GDPR compliance requirements"
        ]
    },
    priority="high"
)
```

### Step 6: Update Shared State

```python
messenger.update_shared_state(
    card_id="card-123",
    updates={
        "agent_status": "COMPLETE",
        "research_report": "/tmp/research/research_report_card-123.md",
        "research_recommendations": {
            "framework": "Flask",
            "database": "PostgreSQL",
            "security_level": "high"
        }
    }
)
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Autonomous Topic Identification

**Task:** "Build a real-time chat application"

**Agent Analysis:**
```
Keywords detected: real-time, chat, application
Complexity: 13 points (complex)
Priority: high

Autonomous Topics Generated:
1. Real-time technology (WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events vs Polling)
2. Chat backend framework (Flask-SocketIO vs Django Channels vs Node.js)
3. Message storage (PostgreSQL vs MongoDB vs Redis)
4. Scaling real-time connections
5. Security for real-time apps
6. Similar chat applications on GitHub
```

**Research finds:**
- WebSocket better than SSE for bidirectional chat
- Flask-SocketIO simpler than Django Channels
- Redis perfect for message queue
- Security: need CSRF protection for WebSocket
- Found 5 similar projects with proven patterns

### Example 2: User-Prompted Research

**Task:** "Add payment processing to e-commerce site"

**User Prompt:** "I want to compare Stripe vs PayPal vs Square. Focus on international support and fees."

**Agent Research:**
```markdown
## User-Requested Research: Payment Gateway Comparison

### Stripe
- International: 135+ currencies, 45+ countries
- Fees: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (US)
- ‚úÖ Best API documentation
- ‚úÖ Strongest developer experience
- ‚ùå Higher fees for some countries

### PayPal
- International: 200+ markets, 100+ currencies
- Fees: 2.9% + $0.30 (US), varies by country
- ‚úÖ Most widely recognized by customers
- ‚úÖ Good buyer protection
- ‚ùå More complex API

### Square
- International: Limited (US, Canada, UK, Australia, Japan)
- Fees: 2.9% + $0.30
- ‚úÖ Great for in-person + online
- ‚ùå Limited international support

**Recommendation for International E-commerce:**
Stripe - Best international support + developer experience
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always cite sources** - Architecture Agent needs to trust findings
2. **Be specific** - "Flask is faster" ‚Üí "Flask: 45ms avg, Django: 60ms avg"
3. **Include dates** - Technology changes, note when research was done
4. **Flag uncertainties** - If data conflicts, note both sides
5. **User prompts first** - Always prioritize user-requested research
6. **Think security** - Always research security implications
7. **Real projects** - Find actual GitHub projects as examples
8. **Version awareness** - Note which versions were researched

---

## Research Agent Activation Logic

```python
def should_run_research(task, workflow_plan):
    """Determine if research stage should run"""

    # Always run if user provided research prompts
    if task.get('user_research_prompts'):
        return True

    # Run for complex tasks
    if workflow_plan['complexity'] == 'complex':
        return True

    # Run for high-priority tasks
    if task['priority'] == 'high':
        return True

    # Run if unfamiliar technology detected
    unfamiliar_keywords = ['oauth', 'websocket', 'graphql', 'kubernetes']
    if any(keyword in task['description'].lower() for keyword in unfamiliar_keywords):
        return True

    # Run if security-critical
    security_keywords = ['payment', 'auth', 'encrypt', 'security']
    if any(keyword in task['description'].lower() for keyword in security_keywords):
        return True

    # Skip for simple tasks
    return False
```
