- ✅ artemis_state_machine.py (2 magic numbers → constants)

**Constants Used:**
- `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3`

**Metrics:**
- Magic numbers: 30+ → 0 (-100%)
- Configuration sources: 4 files → 1 file (-75%)
- Consistency issues: 3 → 0 (-100%)

**Time:** 4 hours

## Current Task (In Progress)

### Days 3-5: Strategy Pattern

**Status:** 🔄 READY TO START
**Estimated Time:** 3 days
**Impact:** HIGH - 231-line method → 15 lines

**Goal:** Refactor `run_full_pipeline()` to use Strategy Pattern for flexible execution modes

**Tasks:**
1. Create `pipeline_strategies.py` with base interface
2. Implement 4 concrete strategies:
   - `StandardPipelineStrategy` - Sequential execution
   - `FastPipelineStrategy` - Skip optional stages
   - `ParallelPipelineStrategy` - Parallel execution where possible
   - `CheckpointPipelineStrategy` - Resume from failures
3. Refactor `artemis_orchestrator.py` to use strategy
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation

**Expected Benefits:**
- Method length: 231 → 15 lines (-93%)
- Code complexity: HIGH → LOW
- Extensibility: Easy to add new execution modes
- Testability: Each strategy independently testable

## Risk Assessment

### Completed Work - All Clear ✅

**Day 1 Risks:** NONE
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ No breaking changes

**Day 2 Risks:** NONE

   - Implement `StandardPipelineStrategy` (current behavior)
   - Implement `FastPipelineStrategy` (skip optional stages)
   - Implement `ParallelPipelineStrategy` (concurrent execution)
   - Implement `CheckpointPipelineStrategy` (resume from failures)

2. **Refactor `artemis_orchestrator.py`**
   - Simplify `run_full_pipeline()` to delegate to strategy
   - Add strategy selection logic
   - Update constructor to accept strategy

3. **Write Tests**
   - Unit tests for each strategy
   - Integration tests for orchestrator
   - Performance tests (ensure no regression)

4. **Update Documentation**
