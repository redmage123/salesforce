## Completed Work ✅

### Week 1 Day 1: Hard-Coded Paths (CRITICAL)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Time Spent:** 4 hours
**Impact:** HIGH

**Accomplishments:**
1. Created `artemis_constants.py` (370 lines) - centralized configuration
2. Fixed 9 files with hard-coded absolute paths
3. System now 100% portable across environments
4. All tests passing

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ artemis_constants.py (NEW)
- ✅ kanban_manager.py
- ✅ developer_invoker.py
- ✅ artemis_services.py
- ✅ test_supervisor_rag.py
- ✅ test_supervisor_integration.py
- ✅ test_workflow_planner.py
- ✅ test_state_machine.py
- ✅ test_checkpoint.py

**Key Improvement:**
```python
# Before: Hard-coded, breaks on other systems
BOARD_PATH = "/home/bbrelin/src/repos/salesforce/.agents/agile/kanban_board.json"

# After: Portable, works anywhere
from artemis_constants import KANBAN_BOARD_PATH
BOARD_PATH = str(KANBAN_BOARD_PATH)
```

**Documentation Created:**
- ✅ WEEK1_DAY1_SUMMARY.md

## Current Work (In Progress)

### Week 1 Days 1-2: Extract Magic Numbers

**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Estimated Time:** 1 day remaining
**Impact:** HIGH

**Magic Numbers Identified:**

| Category | Occurrences | Constant to Use | Files Affected |

| Retry attempts | 30+ | `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` | artemis_orchestrator.py, artemis_workflows.py |
| Sleep intervals | 15+ | `DEFAULT_RETRY_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | supervisor_agent.py, artemis_workflows.py |
| Backoff factors | 10+ | `RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR` | artemis_state_machine.py |
| Timeouts | 8+ | Various timeout constants | artemis_services.py |
| Code review scores | 5+ | `CODE_REVIEW_PASSING_SCORE` | artemis_orchestrator.py |

**Next Steps:**
1. Replace hard-coded retry counts in `artemis_orchestrator.py` (30+ occurrences)
2. Replace sleep intervals in `supervisor_agent.py` (5+ occurrences)
3. Replace backoff factors in `artemis_state_machine.py` (4+ occurrences)
4. Update code review score comparisons
5. Test all changes
