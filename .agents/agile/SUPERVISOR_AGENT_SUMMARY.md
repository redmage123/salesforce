# Artemis Supervisor Agent - Traffic Cop & Circuit Breaker

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Fully Operational
**Integration:** Seamlessly integrated with ArtemisOrchestrator

---

## Overview

The **Supervisor Agent** is Artemis's watchdog and traffic cop, ensuring pipeline resilience through:

- **Process Health Monitoring** - Detects hanging, timing out, and crashed processes
- **Automatic Retry with Exponential Backoff** - Recovers from transient failures
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Temporarily disables failing stages
- **Graceful Failover** - Falls back to alternative strategies when stages fail
- **Resource Cleanup** - Kills zombie processes and cleans up file locks
- **Real-time Alerting** - Notifies via AgentMessenger of critical issues

---

## Problem Solved

### Before Supervisor Agent ❌

```
[Pipeline] Stage 3: Development
  Developer A hanging (90% CPU, 10 minutes)
  Developer B timeout (no response)
  LLM API rate limit exceeded

[Pipeline] ❌ FAILED - Manual intervention required
```

**Issues:**
- Hanging processes blocking pipeline
- No automatic recovery from failures
- Timeouts causing complete pipeline failure
- Zombie processes accumulating
- No visibility into failure patterns

### After Supervisor Agent ✅

```
[Supervisor] ⚠️  Development stage failed: LLM API error
[Supervisor] Retry 1/3 (waiting 10s with backoff)
[Supervisor] ✅ Recovery successful after 2 retries

[Supervisor] ⏰ TIMEOUT detected for code_review (195s > 180s)
[Supervisor] Retry 1/2 (waiting 5s)

[Supervisor] 🚨 Circuit breaker OPEN for validation stage
[Supervisor] Skipping validation (failed 5 times)
[Pipeline] ✅ COMPLETED with graceful degradation
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic recovery from transient failures
- Intelligent retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
- Process health monitoring and cleanup
- Comprehensive failure analytics

---

## Architecture

### SOLID Principles Applied

**Single Responsibility:**
- Supervisor ONLY monitors health and orchestrates recovery
- Does NOT implement stage logic
- Does NOT handle logging (delegates to LoggerInterface)

**Open/Closed:**
- Extensible recovery strategies without modification
- Can add new recovery actions (RETRY, SKIP, ABORT, FALLBACK, RESTART)

**Liskov Substitution:**
- Works with any PipelineStage implementation
- No assumptions about stage internals

**Interface Segregation:**
- Minimal supervision interface
- Stages don't need to know about supervisor

**Dependency Inversion:**
- Depends on PipelineStage abstraction
- Can work with any logger implementation

---

## Key Features

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern

Temporarily disables stages that fail repeatedly:

```python
# After 5 failures within threshold
[Supervisor] 🚨 Circuit breaker OPEN for code_review
[Supervisor] Stage disabled for 300 seconds

# Prevents cascading failures
[Supervisor] Skipping code_review (circuit open)
[Pipeline] Continues with remaining stages
```

**Configuration:**
```python
RecoveryStrategy(
    circuit_breaker_threshold=5,      # Open after 5 failures
    circuit_breaker_timeout_seconds=300.0  # 5 minute cooldown
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents wasting time on repeatedly failing stages
- Allows system to recover
- Automatic retry after cooldown period

### 2. Exponential Backoff Retry

Intelligently retries failed stages with increasing delays:

```python
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: Wait 5s
Attempt 3: Wait 10s (5s × 2.0)
Attempt 4: Wait 20s (10s × 2.0)
```

**Configuration:**
```python
RecoveryStrategy(
    max_retries=3,
    retry_delay_seconds=5.0,
    backoff_multiplier=2.0  # Double delay each retry
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Gives transient errors time to resolve
- Prevents overwhelming failing services
- Increases success rate for intermittent issues

### 3. Timeout Detection

Monitors stage execution time and intervenes:

```python
[Supervisor] ⏰ TIMEOUT detected for development stage
[Supervisor] Elapsed: 615s > Timeout: 600s
[Supervisor] Retry with fresh attempt
```

**Configuration:**
```python
RecoveryStrategy(
    timeout_seconds=600.0  # 10 minutes for development
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents infinite hangs
- Catches stuck processes early
- Enables automatic recovery

### 4. Process Health Monitoring

Detects and kills hanging processes:

```python
[Supervisor] Detected hanging process (PID 12345)
[Supervisor] CPU: 95%, Duration: 320s
[Supervisor] 💀 Killed hanging process 12345 (SIGTERM)
```

**Heuristics:**
- High CPU (>90%) for extended period (>5 minutes)
- Zombie processes
- No progress indicators

**Actions:**
- Graceful termination (SIGTERM)
- Forced kill if needed (SIGKILL)
- Process registry cleanup

### 5. Zombie Process Cleanup

Automatically reaps zombie processes:

```python
[Supervisor] 🧹 Cleaned up 3 zombie processes
```

**When:**
- End of each stage
- End of pipeline
- On demand via cleanup_zombie_processes()

### 6. Health Status Tracking

Real-time health assessment:

```python
HealthStatus.HEALTHY    # All systems operational
HealthStatus.DEGRADED   # 1-2 recent failures
HealthStatus.FAILING    # 3+ recent failures
HealthStatus.CRITICAL   # Circuit breakers open
```

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Total interventions
- Successful recoveries
- Failed recoveries
- Processes killed
- Timeouts detected
- Hanging processes

## Integration with ArtemisOrchestrator

### Automatic Integration

The Supervisor Agent is automatically enabled in ArtemisOrchestrator:

```python
class ArtemisOrchestrator:
    def __init__(
        self,
        card_id: str,
        board: KanbanBoard,
        messenger: AgentMessenger,
        rag: RAGAgent,
        supervisor: Optional[SupervisorAgent] = None,
        enable_supervision: bool = True  # Enabled by default
    ):
        # Create supervisor if not provided
        self.supervisor = supervisor or (SupervisorAgent(
            logger=self.logger,
            messenger=self.messenger,
            verbose=True
        ) if enable_supervision else None)

        # Register all stages with custom recovery strategies
        if self.enable_supervision and self.supervisor:
            self._register_stages_with_supervisor()
```

### Stage Execution Wrapper

All stage executions automatically use supervision:

```python
# In run_full_pipeline()
if self.enable_supervision and self.supervisor:
    result = self.supervisor.execute_with_supervision(
        stage, stage_name, card, context
    )
else:
    result = stage.execute(card, context)
```

### Custom Recovery Strategies Per Stage

Each stage has tailored recovery configuration:

| Stage | Max Retries | Timeout | Retry Delay | Circuit Threshold |
|-------|------------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Project Analysis** | 2 | 120s | 2s | 3 |
| **Architecture** | 2 | 180s | 5s | 3 |
| **Dependencies** | 2 | 60s | 2s | 3 |
| **Development** | 3 | 600s | 10s | 5 (most critical) |
| **Code Review** | 2 | 180s | 5s | 4 |
| **Validation** | 2 | 120s | 3s | 3 |
| **Integration** | 2 | 180s | 5s | 3 |
| **Testing** | 2 | 300s | 5s | 3 |

**Rationale:**
- **Development** gets longest timeout (10 min) and most retries - most critical
- **Dependencies** gets shortest timeout (1 min) - should be fast
- **Code Review** gets higher circuit threshold (4) - expected to have issues
- All use exponential backoff for retry delays

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from supervisor_agent import SupervisorAgent, RecoveryStrategy

# Create supervisor
supervisor = SupervisorAgent(verbose=True)

# Register stage with recovery strategy
supervisor.register_stage(
    "my_stage",
    RecoveryStrategy(
        max_retries=3,
        retry_delay_seconds=5.0,
        timeout_seconds=300.0,
        circuit_breaker_threshold=5
    )
)

# Execute stage with supervision
result = supervisor.execute_with_supervision(
    stage=my_stage,
    stage_name="my_stage",
    *args,
    **kwargs
)
```

### With Fallback Action

```python
def fallback_implementation(*args, **kwargs):
    """Fallback if primary stage fails"""
    return {"status": "success", "method": "fallback"}

supervisor.register_stage(
    "risky_stage",
    RecoveryStrategy(
        max_retries=2,
        fallback_action=fallback_implementation
    )
)
```

### Health Monitoring

```python
# Check overall health
health = supervisor.get_health_status()
print(f"Pipeline Health: {health.value}")

# Get detailed statistics
stats = supervisor.get_statistics()
print(f"Total Interventions: {stats['total_interventions']}")
print(f"Success Rate: {stats['successful_recoveries'] / stats['total_interventions'] * 100}%")

# Print comprehensive report
supervisor.print_health_report()
```

### Process Management

```python
# Detect hanging processes
hanging = supervisor.detect_hanging_processes()
for process in hanging:
    print(f"Hanging: PID {process.pid}, CPU {process.cpu_percent}%")
    supervisor.kill_hanging_process(process.pid)

# Cleanup zombies
cleaned = supervisor.cleanup_zombie_processes()
print(f"Cleaned {cleaned} zombie processes")
```

---

## Integration with Other Components

### AgentMessenger Integration

Supervisor sends real-time alerts:

```python
# Circuit breaker alert
messenger.send_message(
    "🚨 CIRCUIT BREAKER OPEN: development",
    "Stage has failed 5 times. Temporarily disabled for 300s"
)

# Timeout alert
messenger.send_message(
    "⏰ TIMEOUT: code_review",
    "Stage exceeded timeout of 180s (elapsed: 195s)"
)

# Recovery alert
messenger.send_message(
    "✅ RECOVERY SUCCESSFUL: validation",
    "Stage recovered after 2 retries"
)
```

### Redis Metrics Integration

Supervisor statistics can be tracked in Redis:

```python
from redis_metrics import RedisMetrics

metrics = RedisMetrics()

# Track supervisor interventions
metrics.track_pipeline_completion(
    card_id="card-001",
    duration_seconds=125.0,
    status="COMPLETED",
    total_cost=0.08,
    metadata={
        "supervisor_interventions": supervisor_stats["total_interventions"],
        "successful_recoveries": supervisor_stats["successful_recoveries"],
        "failed_recoveries": supervisor_stats["failed_recoveries"]
    }
)
```

### Pipeline Report Integration

Supervisor statistics included in pipeline reports:

```json
{
  "card_id": "card-20251023-001",
  "status": "COMPLETED_SUCCESSFULLY",
  "stages": {...},
  "supervisor_statistics": {
    "overall_health": "healthy",
    "total_interventions": 7,
    "successful_recoveries": 6,

        "avg_duration_seconds": 245.5,
        "circuit_open": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Impact

### Overhead

**Minimal overhead when stages succeed:**
- < 1ms per stage execution (supervision wrapper)
- No background threads running (unless monitoring timeout)
- Lazy initialization of monitoring

**Overhead during recovery:**
- Retry delays (configured per stage)
- Exponential backoff (intentional delay for recovery)
- Process health checks (only when needed)

### Resource Usage

**Memory:**
- Supervisor agent: ~1-2 MB
- Process registry: ~100 bytes per monitored process
- Health tracking: ~500 bytes per stage

**CPU:**
- Idle: 0%
- Monitoring: < 1% (background thread checks every 5s)
- Process health check: < 1% (uses psutil efficiently)

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Tune Recovery Strategies Per Stage

```python
# Fast, non-critical stages
RecoveryStrategy(
    max_retries=2,
    retry_delay_seconds=2.0,
    timeout_seconds=60.0
)

# Critical, expensive stages
RecoveryStrategy(
    max_retries=3,
    retry_delay_seconds=10.0,
    backoff_multiplier=2.0,
    timeout_seconds=600.0,
    circuit_breaker_threshold=5
)
```

### 2. Use Fallback Actions for Critical Stages

```python
def simplified_code_review(*args, **kwargs):
    """Simplified review if full review fails"""
    return {"status": "PASS", "method": "simplified", "confidence": "low"}

supervisor.register_stage(
    "code_review",
    RecoveryStrategy(
        max_retries=2,
        fallback_action=simplified_code_review
    )
)
```

### 3. Monitor Health Metrics

```python
# Check health after each pipeline
health = supervisor.get_health_status()

if health == HealthStatus.DEGRADED:
    logger.warn("⚠️  Pipeline health degraded")
elif health == HealthStatus.FAILING:
    logger.error("❌ Pipeline health failing - investigate!")
elif health == HealthStatus.CRITICAL:
    logger.error("🚨 CRITICAL - Circuit breakers open!")
```

### 4. Clean Up Regularly

```python
# End of pipeline
supervisor.cleanup_zombie_processes()

# Periodic maintenance
if pipeline_count % 10 == 0:
    supervisor.cleanup_zombie_processes()
    supervisor.print_health_report()
```

---

## Disabling Supervision

For testing or debugging, you can disable supervision:

```python
# Disable for specific orchestrator
orchestrator = ArtemisOrchestrator(
    card_id="test-001",
    board=board,
    messenger=messenger,
    rag=rag,
    enable_supervision=False  # Disable supervisor
)

# Or set via environment variable
import os
os.environ["ARTEMIS_DISABLE_SUPERVISION"] = "true"
```

**Use Cases for Disabling:**
- Unit testing individual stages
- Debugging stage-specific issues
- Performance benchmarking
- Minimal overhead requirement

## Troubleshooting

### High Intervention Rate

**Problem:**
```
Total Interventions: 50
Successful Recoveries: 10
Failed Recoveries: 40
```

**Solutions:**
- Increase retry delays (give more time to recover)
- Lower circuit breaker threshold (fail faster)
- Investigate root cause of failures
- Add fallback actions for critical stages

### Circuit Breakers Frequently Opening

**Problem:**
```
Circuit Breaker: 🚨 OPEN for multiple stages
```

**Solutions:**
- Increase circuit breaker threshold
- Reduce circuit breaker timeout (recover faster)
- Fix underlying stage issues
- Add better error handling in stages

### Timeouts on Fast Stages

**Problem:**
```
⏰ TIMEOUT detected for dependencies stage (65s > 60s)
```

**Solutions:**
- Increase timeout_seconds for stage
- Optimize stage implementation
- Check for network/I/O bottlenecks
