## Integration Status

### ‚úÖ Integrated with Artemis Orchestrator

The Supervisor Agent is fully integrated with `artemis_orchestrator_solid.py`:

**Line 44:**
```python
from supervisor_agent import SupervisorAgent, RecoveryStrategy
```

**Line 211:**
```python
self.supervisor = supervisor or (SupervisorAgent(
    logger=self.logger,
    messenger=self.messenger,
    verbose=self.verbose
) if enable_supervision else None)
```

**Stage Registration (lines 240-328):**
All 8 pipeline stages are registered with the supervisor:
1. project_analysis
2. architecture
3. dependency_analysis
4. development
5. code_review
6. validation
7. integration
8. testing

**Supervised Execution (lines 428-429, 522-523):**
```python
if self.enable_supervision and self.supervisor:
    result = self.supervisor.execute_with_supervision(
        stage, stage_name, ...
    )
```

**Health Reporting (lines 563-567):**
```python
if self.enable_supervision and self.supervisor:
    self.supervisor.print_health_report()
    cleaned = self.supervisor.cleanup_zombie_processes()
```

## Code Quality

### SOLID Principles ‚úÖ

The Supervisor Agent follows SOLID principles:

**Single Responsibility:**
- Only monitors and recovers pipeline health
- No business logic or stage implementation

**Open/Closed:**
- Extensible recovery strategies without modification
- Custom strategies can be added

**Liskov Substitution:**
- Works with any PipelineStage implementation
- No assumptions about stage internals

**Interface Segregation:**
- Minimal supervision interface
- Stages don't need supervisor-specific code

**Dependency Inversion:**
- Depends on abstractions (PipelineStage, LoggerInterface)
- Not coupled to concrete implementations

## Performance Characteristics

### Retry Delays (Default Strategy)

| Retry # | Delay | Cumulative Time |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| 1       | 5s    | 5s              |
| 2       | 10s   | 15s             |
| 3       | 20s   | 35s             |

### Circuit Breaker

- **Default Threshold:** 5 failures
- **Default Timeout:** 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Auto-recovery:** Circuit closes after timeout expires

### Resource Usage

- **Memory:** Minimal (lightweight statistics tracking)
- **CPU:** Low (monitoring runs in background threads)
- **I/O:** Minimal (only alert messages via messenger)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Timeout Monitoring:** Currently runs in background threads but not tested in this suite
2. **Process Hanging Detection:** Implemented but not tested (requires long-running processes)
3. **Zombie Process Cleanup:** Implemented but not tested (requires process spawning)
4. **Fallback Actions:** Supported but not tested in this suite

---

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Production Ready

The Supervisor Agent is **production-ready** for:
- Automatic retry and recovery
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Health monitoring
- Alert integration

### Future Enhancements

1. **Add Timeout Tests**
   - Test timeout detection with slow stages
   - Verify timeout alerts are sent

2. **Add Process Management Tests**
   - Test hanging process detection
   - Test zombie cleanup

3. **Add Fallback Action Tests**
   - Test custom fallback actions
   - Test fallback failure scenarios

4. **Add Metrics Export**
   - Export statistics to monitoring systems (Prometheus, Datadog)
   - Add time-series health tracking
