## Architecture

### State Machine vs Pushdown Automaton

**Q: Why use a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) instead of a regular finite state machine?**

**A:** A PDA provides critical capabilities that a regular state machine cannot:

1. **Stack-based Context** - Track nested stage executions and recovery attempts
2. **Backtracking** - Rollback to previous states in LIFO order (perfect for undo operations)
3. **Nested Workflows** - Recovery workflows can trigger other recovery workflows
4. **Context Preservation** - Store execution context at each state for debugging

### Example: Why the Stack Matters

```
Regular State Machine (FSM):
IDLE → RUNNING → FAILED → RECOVERING → ???

Problem: When recovery fails, we can't backtrack to a known good state.

Pushdown Automaton (PDA):
IDLE (pushed to stack)
  → RUNNING (pushed to stack)
    → STAGE_RUNNING:development (pushed to stack)
      → FAILED (pushed to stack)
        → RECOVERING (pushed to stack)
          → [Recovery fails]
          → pop() → RECOVERING removed
          → pop() → FAILED removed
          → pop() → STAGE_RUNNING removed
          → Now back at RUNNING - we can retry!

Solution: Stack enables rollback to any previous state!
```

## State Definitions

### Pipeline States

The state machine tracks the overall pipeline state:

| State | Description | Can Transition To |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **IDLE** | Not started | INITIALIZING, ABORTED |
| **INITIALIZING** | Setting up | RUNNING, FAILED, ABORTED |
| **RUNNING** | Active execution | STAGE_RUNNING, PAUSED, COMPLETED, FAILED, DEGRADED, ABORTED |
| **STAGE_RUNNING** | Individual stage executing | STAGE_COMPLETED, STAGE_FAILED, STAGE_RETRYING, STAGE_SKIPPED, RUNNING |
| **STAGE_FAILED** | Stage failed | STAGE_RETRYING, RECOVERING, FAILED, ROLLING_BACK |
| **RECOVERING** | Attempting recovery | RUNNING, DEGRADED, FAILED, ROLLING_BACK |
| **DEGRADED** | Partial success | RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED |
| **PAUSED** | Temporarily suspended | RUNNING, ABORTED |
| **ROLLING_BACK** | Reverting changes | FAILED, ABORTED |
| **FAILED** | Failed execution | RECOVERING, ROLLING_BACK, ABORTED |
| **COMPLETED** | Successfully finished | *(terminal state)* |
| **ABORTED** | Manually aborted | *(terminal state)* |
| **HEALTHY** | All systems operational | DEGRADED_HEALTH |
| **DEGRADED_HEALTH** | Some issues detected | CRITICAL, HEALTHY |
| **CRITICAL** | Critical failures | FAILED |

### Stage States

Each individual stage can be in one of these states:

- **PENDING** - Not yet started
- **RUNNING** - Currently executing
- **COMPLETED** - Successfully finished
- **FAILED** - Execution failed
- **RETRYING** - Retrying after failure
- **SKIPPED** - Skipped (circuit breaker open)
- **CIRCUIT_OPEN** - Circuit breaker is open
- **TIMED_OUT** - Exceeded timeout
- **ROLLED_BACK** - Changes reverted

---

## Event-Driven Transitions

State transitions are triggered by events:

### Lifecycle Events
- **START** - Pipeline starting
- **COMPLETE** - Pipeline completed
- **FAIL** - Pipeline failed
- **ABORT** - Pipeline aborted
- **PAUSE** - Pipeline paused

### Recovery Events
- **RECOVERY_START** - Recovery starting
- **RECOVERY_SUCCESS** - Recovery succeeded
- **RECOVERY_FAIL** - Recovery failed
- **ROLLBACK_START** - Rollback starting
- **ROLLBACK_COMPLETE** - Rollback completed

### Health Events

## Workflow Structure

Each workflow consists of:

1. **Issue Type** - What problem it solves
2. **Actions** - Sequential steps to resolve the issue
3. **Success State** - Where to transition on success
4. **Failure State** - Where to transition on failure
5. **Rollback Strategy** - Whether to rollback on failure

### Example Workflow: Timeout Recovery

```python
Workflow(
    name="Timeout Recovery",
    issue_type=IssueType.TIMEOUT,
    actions=[
        WorkflowAction(
            action_name="Increase timeout",
            handler=increase_timeout,
            retry_on_failure=False
        ),
        WorkflowAction(
            action_name="Kill hanging process",
            handler=kill_hanging_process,
            retry_on_failure=True,
            max_retries=2
        )
    ],
    success_state=PipelineState.RUNNING,
    failure_state=PipelineState.FAILED,
    rollback_on_failure=False
)
```

### Example Workflow: Memory Exhausted

```python
Workflow(
    name="Memory Recovery",
    issue_type=IssueType.MEMORY_EXHAUSTED,
    actions=[
        WorkflowAction(
            action_name="Free memory",
            handler=free_memory  # Runs garbage collection
        ),
        WorkflowAction(
            action_name="Cleanup temp files",
            handler=cleanup_temp_files  # Removes /tmp files
        )
    ],
    success_state=PipelineState.RUNNING,
    failure_state=PipelineState.FAILED
)
```

## Pushdown Automaton Features

### Stack Operations

The state machine implements a **stack** for backtracking:

#### Push State
```python
sm.push_state(PipelineState.RUNNING, {"stage": "development"})
# Stack: [RUNNING]
```

#### Pop State
```python
popped = sm.pop_state()
# Returns: {"state": RUNNING, "timestamp": ..., "context": {"stage": "development"}}
```

#### Peek State
```python
top = sm.peek_state()
# Returns top without removing it
```

#### Rollback to State
```python
# Stack: [IDLE, RUNNING, STAGE_RUNNING, FAILED, RECOVERING]
sm.rollback_to_state(PipelineState.RUNNING)
# Pops RECOVERING, FAILED, STAGE_RUNNING
# Now at RUNNING
```

### Use Cases for Stack

1. **Nested Stage Execution**
   ```
   IDLE
     → RUNNING
       → STAGE_RUNNING: architecture
       → STAGE_RUNNING: development
         → STAGE_RUNNING: developer-a
         → STAGE_RUNNING: developer-b
   ```

2. **Recovery Chain**
   ```
   RUNNING
     → STAGE_FAILED
       → RECOVERING (workflow 1)
         → RECOVERING (workflow 2)  # Nested recovery
   ```

3. **Rollback on Failure**
   ```
   IDLE
     → RUNNING
       → STAGE_RUNNING: integration
         → FAILED (merge conflict)
         → ROLLING_BACK
   rollback_to_state(RUNNING) → back before integration
   ```

---

## State Persistence

States are automatically persisted to disk:

### Storage Location
```
/tmp/artemis_state/{card_id}_state.json
```

### Persisted Data
```json
{
  "state": "running",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T12:34:56",
  "card_id": "card-20251023123456",
  "active_stage": "development",
  "health_status": "healthy",
  "circuit_breakers_open": [],
  "active_issues": [],
  "stages": {
    "development": {
      "stage_name": "development",
      "state": "running",
      "start_time": "2025-10-23T12:30:00",
      "end_time": null,
      "duration_seconds": 0.0,
      "retry_count": 0,
      "error_message": null,
      "metadata": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Automatic Saving

State is saved after every:
- State transition
- Stage state update
- Issue registration
- Workflow execution

---

## Supervisor Integration

The state machine is fully integrated with the Supervisor Agent:

### Creating Supervisor with State Machine

```python
from supervisor_agent import SupervisorAgent

supervisor = SupervisorAgent(
    card_id="card-123",  # Enable state machine
    verbose=True
)
```

### Using State Machine Features

#### Handle Issue
```python
supervisor.handle_issue(
    IssueType.TIMEOUT,
    context={"pid": 12345, "stage_name": "development"}
)
```

#### Get State Snapshot
```python
snapshot = supervisor.get_state_snapshot()
print(f"Current state: {snapshot['state']}")
print(f"Active issues: {snapshot['active_issues']}")
```

#### Rollback to Stage
```python
supervisor.rollback_to_stage("architecture")
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic State Machine

```python
from artemis_state_machine import ArtemisStateMachine, PipelineState, EventType

# Create state machine
sm = ArtemisStateMachine(card_id="card-001")

# Transition states
sm.transition(PipelineState.INITIALIZING, EventType.START)
sm.transition(PipelineState.RUNNING, EventType.STAGE_START)

# Track stage
sm.update_stage_state("development", StageState.RUNNING)

# Get snapshot
snapshot = sm.get_snapshot()
```

### Example 2: Handle Issue with Workflow

```python
from artemis_state_machine import ArtemisStateMachine, IssueType

sm = ArtemisStateMachine(card_id="card-002")

# Register and resolve issue
sm.register_issue(IssueType.MEMORY_EXHAUSTED)

success = sm.execute_workflow(
    IssueType.MEMORY_EXHAUSTED,
    context={}
)

if success:
    print("✅ Memory issue resolved!")
```

### Example 3: Pushdown Automaton Rollback

```python
sm = ArtemisStateMachine(card_id="card-003")

# Push states as pipeline progresses
sm.push_state(PipelineState.IDLE)
sm.push_state(PipelineState.RUNNING)
sm.push_state(PipelineState.STAGE_RUNNING, {"stage": "development"})
sm.push_state(PipelineState.FAILED, {"error": "test failure"})

# Rollback to previous good state
sm.rollback_to_state(PipelineState.RUNNING)
# Now we can retry from RUNNING state
```

### Example 4: Full Supervisor Integration

```python
from supervisor_agent import SupervisorAgent, RecoveryStrategy
from artemis_state_machine import IssueType

# Create supervisor with state machine
supervisor = SupervisorAgent(card_id="card-004", verbose=True)

# Register stages
supervisor.register_stage("architecture")
supervisor.register_stage("development", RecoveryStrategy(max_retries=5))

# Execute stage with supervision
class MyStage:
    def execute(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Stage implementation
        return {"status": "success"}

result = supervisor.execute_with_supervision(
    MyStage(),
    "development"
)

# Handle issues if they occur
if "error" in result:
    supervisor.handle_issue(
        IssueType.TIMEOUT,
        context={"stage_name": "development"}
    )

# Get complete state
snapshot = supervisor.get_state_snapshot()
print(f"Pipeline state: {snapshot['state']}")
print(f"Stages: {snapshot['stages']}")
print(f"Issues: {snapshot['active_issues']}")
```

---

## Advanced Features

### 1. Nested Workflows

Workflows can trigger other workflows:

```python
# Workflow A encounters an issue
workflow_a_executes()
  → detects MEMORY_EXHAUSTED
  → triggers Memory Recovery Workflow
    → frees memory
    → cleanup temp files
  → returns to Workflow A
  → continues execution
```

### 2. Contextual Recovery

Each state in the stack stores context:

```python
{
  "state": PipelineState.STAGE_RUNNING,
  "context": {
    "stage": "development",
    "developer": "developer-a",
    "retry_count": 2,
    "timeout_seconds": 300
  }
}
```

### 3. Audit Trail

Complete history of all transitions:

```python
for transition in sm.state_history:
    print(f"{transition.timestamp}: {transition.from_state} → {transition.to_state}")
    print(f"  Event: {transition.event}")
    print(f"  Reason: {transition.reason}")
```

### 4. Workflow History

Track all workflow executions:

```python
for execution in sm.workflow_history:
    print(f"Workflow: {execution.workflow_name}")
    print(f"Success: {execution.success}")
    print(f"Actions: {execution.actions_taken}")
    print(f"Duration: {execution.end_time - execution.start_time}")
```
