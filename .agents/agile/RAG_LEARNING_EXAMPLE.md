# RAG Learning Example: How the Pipeline Gets Smarter Over Time

This document demonstrates how the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Agent enables continuous learning and improvement across multiple pipeline executions.

---

## Scenario: Building Authentication Features Over Time

We'll track how the pipeline learns from implementing multiple authentication-related tasks.

---

## Task 1: "Add Google OAuth login" (Week 1)

### Pipeline Start - RAG Query

```
üß† QUERYING RAG FOR HISTORICAL CONTEXT
No similar tasks found in RAG database (building new knowledge)
```

**Result:** Pipeline has no historical context. Starts from scratch.

---

### Research Stage

**Research Findings:**
```markdown
# Research Report: OAuth Libraries

## Comparison

### authlib
- GitHub: 4.3k stars
- Maintained: ‚úÖ Active (last commit: 3 days ago)
- Documentation: Excellent
- Security: CVE-free in last 12 months

### python-social-auth
- GitHub: 2.8k stars
- Maintained: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Less active (last commit: 45 days ago)
- Documentation: Good
- Security: 1 minor CVE patched

### oauthlib
- GitHub: 2.5k stars
- Low-level library (requires more setup)

## Recommendation
Use **authlib** - most actively maintained, best docs
```

**RAG Storage:**
```python
rag.store_artifact(
    artifact_type="research_report",
    card_id="card-001",
    task_title="Add Google OAuth login",
    content="<full research report>",
    metadata={
        "technologies": ["authlib", "OAuth2", "Google"],
        "recommendation": "authlib",
        "confidence": "HIGH",
        "user_prompts_count": 0,
        "autonomous": True
    }
)
```

---

### Architecture Stage

**ADR Created:**
```markdown
# ADR-001: OAuth Authentication with Google

## Decision
Use authlib library for OAuth2 implementation

## Reasoning
- Most actively maintained (research shows commits within 3 days)
- Excellent documentation
- Security track record clean
```

**RAG Storage:**
```python
rag.store_artifact(
    artifact_type="architecture_decision",
    card_id="card-001",
    task_title="Add Google OAuth login",
    content="<full ADR>",
    metadata={
        "adr_number": "001",
        "technologies": ["authlib", "OAuth2", "Google"],
        "decision": "Use authlib for OAuth"
    }
)
```

---

### Development Stage (2 developers in parallel)

**Developer A (Conservative):**
- Basic OAuth flow
- Token storage (plain text - BLOCKED in validation)
- Test coverage: 82%

**Developer B (Aggressive):**
- OAuth flow with error handling
- AES-256 token encryption ‚úÖ
- CSRF protection ‚úÖ
- Test coverage: 91%

---

### Arbitration Stage

**Scores:**
- Developer A: **72/100** (blocked on unencrypted tokens)
- Developer B: **95/100** (comprehensive solution)

**Winner:** Developer B

**RAG Storage:**
```python
rag.store_artifact(
    artifact_type="arbitration_score",
    card_id="card-001",
    task_title="Add Google OAuth login",
    content="<arbitration results>",
    metadata={
        "winner": "developer-b",
        "developer_a_score": 72,
        "developer_b_score": 95,
        "winning_approach": "comprehensive with encryption"
    }
)
```

---

### Integration & Testing

**Integration:** ‚úÖ PASS (all tests passing)
**Testing:** ‚úÖ PASS (quality gates passed)

**RAG Storage:**
```python
rag.store_artifact(
    artifact_type="integration_result",
    card_id="card-001",
    metadata={
        "status": "PASS",
        "technologies": ["authlib", "OAuth2"],
        "success": True
    }
)

rag.store_artifact(
    artifact_type="testing_result",
    card_id="card-001",
    metadata={
        "status": "PASS",
        "uiux_score": 88,
        "performance_score": 85,
        "production_ready": True
    }
)
```

---

### Pipeline End - RAG Stats

```
üìä RAG Database Statistics:
  Total artifacts stored: 5
  Artifacts by type:
    - research_report: 1
    - architecture_decision: 1
    - arbitration_score: 1
    - integration_result: 1
    - testing_result: 1
```

**Task 1 Complete!** RAG now has institutional knowledge about OAuth.

---

## Task 2: "Add GitHub OAuth login" (Week 2)

### Pipeline Start - RAG Query (NOW WITH HISTORY!)

```
üß† QUERYING RAG FOR HISTORICAL CONTEXT

üìö RAG Insights (1 similar task found):
Confidence: HIGH

Based on history:
  ‚Ä¢ Used authlib in 1 past OAuth task (score: 95/100)
  ‚Ä¢ Winner used AES-256 token encryption (developer-b approach)
  ‚Ä¢ Security: Unencrypted tokens blocked validation (developer-a)

Recommendations:
  ‚úì Consider authlib (proven success in task card-001)
  ‚úì Implement token encryption (critical for passing validation)
  ‚úì Use comprehensive approach (scored 23 points higher)

Things to avoid:
  ‚ö† Plain text token storage (blocked in card-001)
```

**Impact:** Pipeline now has informed recommendations BEFORE starting!

---

### Research Stage - **REUSE EXISTING RESEARCH**

```
üìä RESEARCH STAGE - Checking RAG for existing research

üîç Found similar research from 6 days ago:
  - Task: "Add Google OAuth login" (card-001)
  - Topic: OAuth library comparison
  - Similarity: 0.94 (VERY HIGH)
  - Age: 6 days (RECENT)
  - Recommendation: authlib

‚úÖ DECISION: Reuse existing research
   REASON: Highly similar (94%) and recent (<30 days)
   TIME SAVED: ~3 minutes
```

**Research Report (Generated):**
```markdown
# Research Report: GitHub OAuth login

## Reused Research

This task is highly similar to **card-001** (Google OAuth login).

### Previous Research Findings (6 days ago)
- **authlib** was recommended (4.3k stars, actively maintained)
- Security track record: CVE-free
- Documentation quality: Excellent

### New Research for GitHub-Specific Features
- GitHub OAuth endpoints: https://github.com/login/oauth/
- Scopes needed: user:email, read:user
- authlib supports GitHub out-of-box ‚úÖ

## Recommendation
**Reuse authlib** - same library works for GitHub OAuth
**New insight:** Use scopes=['user:email', 'read:user']

**Time Savings:** 3 minutes (research reused)
```

**RAG Storage:**
```python
rag.store_artifact(
    artifact_type="research_report",
    card_id="card-002",
    task_title="Add GitHub OAuth login",
    content="<research report with reused data>",
    metadata={
        "technologies": ["authlib", "OAuth2", "GitHub"],
        "recommendation": "authlib",
        "confidence": "VERY_HIGH",  # Higher confidence due to past success
        "research_reused": True,
        "based_on_task": "card-001",
        "time_saved_minutes": 3
    }
)
```

---

### Architecture Stage - **INFORMED BY PAST ADR**

**RAG Query:**
```python
past_adrs = rag.query_similar("OAuth authentication architecture", top_k=5)

# Returns:
[
  {
    "artifact_id": "adr-card-001",
    "similarity": 0.92,
    "task_title": "Add Google OAuth login",
    "metadata": {
      "adr_number": "001",
      "technologies": ["authlib", "OAuth2"],
      "decision": "Use authlib for OAuth"
    }
  }
]
```

**ADR Created (citing past decision):**
```markdown
# ADR-002: GitHub OAuth Authentication

## Decision
Use authlib library for GitHub OAuth2 implementation

## Reasoning
Building on ADR-001 (Google OAuth):
- **authlib** proved successful (95/100 score in card-001)
- Same library supports both Google and GitHub
- Consistency across OAuth implementations
- **Critical from past:** Must encrypt tokens (AES-256)

## Reference
This decision aligns with ADR-001 and leverages proven patterns
from card-001 (completed 6 days ago with 100% success).
```

**Impact:** Architecture decision is now data-backed, not just guessing!

---

### Development Stage - **DEVELOPERS LEARN FROM PAST**

**RAG Query by Developers:**
```python
# Both developers query RAG before implementing:
past_solutions = rag.query_similar(
    "OAuth implementation token encryption",
    artifact_types=["developer_solution", "validation_result"],
    top_k=5
)

# Returns insights:
{
  "high_scoring_solution": {
    "card_id": "card-001",
    "winner": "developer-b",
    "score": 95,
    "key_features": [
      "AES-256 token encryption",
      "CSRF protection",
      "91% test coverage",
      "Comprehensive error handling"
    ]
  },
  "blocked_solution": {
    "card_id": "card-001",
    "developer": "developer-a",
    "blocker": "Unencrypted tokens (security issue)",
    "lesson": "ALWAYS encrypt OAuth tokens"
  }
}
```

**Developer A (Conservative) - LEARNS FROM PAST:**
- OAuth flow with authlib ‚úÖ
- **AES-256 token encryption** ‚úÖ (learned from card-001 failure)
- CSRF protection ‚úÖ (saw it in winning solution)
- Test coverage: 86% (‚Üë from 82%)

**Developer B (Aggressive) - BUILDS ON SUCCESS:**
- OAuth flow with advanced error handling ‚úÖ
- AES-256 token encryption ‚úÖ
- CSRF protection ‚úÖ
- **NEW:** Refresh token rotation ‚úÖ
- **NEW:** OAuth state parameter validation ‚úÖ
- Test coverage: 93% (‚Üë from 91%)

**Impact:** BOTH developers pass validation this time!

---

### Validation Stage

**Developer A:** ‚úÖ **APPROVED** (encryption present - no blocker!)
**Developer B:** ‚úÖ **APPROVED** (enhanced security)

---

### Arbitration Stage

**Scores:**
- Developer A: **87/100** (‚Üë15 points from card-001!)
- Developer B: **97/100** (‚Üë2 points from card-001!)

**Winner:** Developer B (but both would be acceptable)

**RAG Storage:**
```python
rag.store_artifact(
    artifact_type="arbitration_score",
    card_id="card-002",
    metadata={
        "winner": "developer-b",
        "developer_a_score": 87,  # Improved!
        "developer_b_score": 97,  # Also improved!
        "learning_applied": True,
        "improvement_over_card_001": {
            "developer_a": "+15 points",
            "developer_b": "+2 points"
        }
    }
)
```

  ‚Ä¢ Architecture informed by ADR-001
  ‚Ä¢ Both developers learned from card-001 failures
  ‚Ä¢ Developer A improved +15 points (now passing validation)
  ‚Ä¢ Developer B improved +2 points (now near-perfect)
```

**Task 2 Complete!** Pipeline is getting smarter!

---

## Task 3: "Add Microsoft OAuth login" (Week 4)

### Pipeline Start - RAG Query (STRONG PATTERNS EMERGING)

```
üß† QUERYING RAG FOR HISTORICAL CONTEXT

üìö RAG Insights (2 similar tasks found):
Confidence: VERY HIGH

Based on history:
  ‚Ä¢ authlib used in 2 OAuth tasks (avg score: 96/100, 100% success)
  ‚Ä¢ Winner approach: comprehensive with encryption (2/2 times)
  ‚Ä¢ AES-256 encryption REQUIRED (1 blocker in card-001 without it)
  ‚Ä¢ CSRF protection standard in all passing solutions
  ‚Ä¢ Refresh token rotation added in card-002 (improved security)

Recommendations:
  ‚úì Use authlib (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - 2/2 successes, 96 avg score)
  ‚úì Implement AES-256 token encryption (CRITICAL - blocked otherwise)
  ‚úì Include CSRF protection (found in all successful solutions)
  ‚úì Consider refresh token rotation (improved score in card-002)
  ‚úì Aim for 90%+ test coverage (winners averaged 92% coverage)

Things to avoid:
  ‚ö† Plain text token storage (BLOCKER in card-001)
  ‚ö† Missing CSRF protection (security risk)
  ‚ö† Test coverage <85% (correlates with lower scores)
```

**Impact:** Pipeline now has STRONG data-backed recommendations!

---

### Research Stage - **INSTANT KNOWLEDGE**

```
‚úÖ SKIP RESEARCH - Reusing findings from card-001, card-002
   Similarity: 0.96 (EXTREMELY HIGH)
   Age: 27 days (still recent)

### RAG Pattern Extraction

After 3 OAuth tasks, RAG extracts patterns:

```python
patterns = rag.extract_patterns(
    pattern_type="technology_success_rates",
    time_window_days=30
)

# Results:
{
  "authlib": {
    "tasks_count": 3,
    "avg_score": 96.3,
    "success_rate": 1.0,  # 100%!
    "recommendation": "HIGHLY_RECOMMENDED"
  },
  "OAuth2": {
    "tasks_count": 3,
    "avg_score": 96.3,
    "success_rate": 1.0,
    "recommendation": "HIGHLY_RECOMMENDED"
  }
}

best_practices = rag.extract_best_practices()

# Results:
{
  "security": {
    "AES-256 token encryption": 3,  # Found in 3/3 high-scoring solutions
    "CSRF protection": 3,
    "Refresh token rotation": 2
  },
  "testing": {
    "90%+ test coverage": 3,
    "Unit + integration tests": 3
  }
}

anti_patterns = rag.detect_anti_patterns()

# Results:
{
  "unencrypted_tokens": {
    "count": 1,
    "impact": "BLOCKER",
    "message": "Plain text tokens blocked validation in card-001"
  }
}
```
