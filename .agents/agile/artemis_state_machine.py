"""
Artemis State Machine - Pipeline State Tracking and Management

Tracks the complete state of the Artemis pipeline and manages state transitions.
Provides workflows to handle all possible failure scenarios and recovery paths.

State Machine Design:
- States represent pipeline execution phases
- Transitions are triggered by events (success, failure, timeout, etc.)
- Workflows handle recovery for each failure scenario
- State history is tracked for debugging and rollback

SOLID Principles:
- Single Responsibility: Only manages state transitions and workflows
- Open/Closed: Extensible with new states and workflows
- Liskov Substitution: State implementations are interchangeable
- Interface Segregation: Minimal state interface
- Dependency Inversion: Depends on state abstractions
