# Supervisor Learning System - Complete! üéâ

**Status:** ‚úÖ All 5/5 tests passing
**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Feature:** Autonomous Learning & Adaptation

---

## Overview

The supervisor agent now has **autonomous learning capability** that enables it to:

1. **Detect** unexpected states automatically
2. **Learn** solutions by querying LLM (GPT-4o/Claude)
3. **Generate** dynamic recovery workflows
4. **Store** learned solutions in RAG for future reuse
5. **Adapt** and improve over time through experience

This is a **game-changing capability** that allows Artemis to handle novel failure scenarios without human intervention!

## üß† How It Works

### 1. Unexpected State Detection

When the pipeline enters an unexpected state:

```python
# Supervisor detects unexpected state
unexpected = supervisor.handle_unexpected_state(
    current_state="STAGE_STUCK",
    expected_states=["STAGE_RUNNING", "STAGE_COMPLETED"],
    context={
        "stage_name": "development",
        "error_message": "Developer agents not responding",
        "previous_state": "STAGE_RUNNING"
    }
)
```

**What Gets Captured:**
- Current state vs. expected states
- Error messages and stack traces
- Full context (stage, card_id, previous state)
- Severity assessment (low, medium, high, critical)

---

### 2. LLM Consultation

The supervisor asks an LLM for a solution:

**Prompt sent to LLM:**
```
You are an expert DevOps/SRE engineer helping debug an autonomous AI development pipeline called Artemis.

UNEXPECTED STATE DETECTED:

Current State: STAGE_STUCK
Expected States: STAGE_RUNNING, STAGE_COMPLETED
Severity: high

CONTEXT:
Card ID: card-003
Stage: development
Previous State: STAGE_RUNNING

ERROR INFORMATION:
Developer agents stuck

TASK:
Analyze this unexpected state and provide a step-by-step recovery workflow...
```

**LLM Response (Structured JSON):**
```json
{
  "problem_analysis": "Developer agents are stuck in infinite loop waiting for response",
  "root_cause": "Message queue deadlock between developer-a and developer-b",
  "solution_description": "Clear message queue and restart stuck agents",
  "workflow_steps": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "action": "cleanup_resources",
      "description": "Clear stuck message queue",
      "parameters": {"queue_name": "developer_messages"}
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "action": "restart_process",
      "description": "Restart developer agents",
      "parameters": {"agents": ["developer-a", "developer-b"]}
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "action": "retry_stage",
      "description": "Retry development stage",
      "parameters": {"stage": "development"}
    }
  ],
  "confidence": "high",
  "risks": ["May lose in-progress work"],
  "alternative_approaches": ["Manual intervention", "Rollback to checkpoint"]
}
```

---

### 3. Dynamic Workflow Execution

The supervisor executes the learned workflow:

```python
# Apply learned solution
success = supervisor.learning_engine.apply_learned_solution(solution, context)

# Workflow executes:
# Step 1: Cleanup resources ‚úÖ
# Step 2: Restart process ‚úÖ
# Step 3: Retry stage ‚úÖ

# Result: Problem solved!
```

**Tracked Metrics:**
- Times applied
- Times successful
- Success rate (100% in tests!)

---

### 4. Knowledge Storage (RAG)

Solution is stored in RAG for future use:

```python
# Stored in RAG as artifact
{
  "artifact_type": "learned_solution",
  "content": "Solution: Clear message queue and restart stuck agents\n\n" +
             "Problem: Unexpected state STAGE_STUCK...",
  "metadata": {
    "solution_id": "learned-abc123",
    "workflow_steps": [...],
    "success_rate": 1.0,
    "learning_strategy": "llm_consultation",
    "llm_model_used": "gpt-4o"
  }
}
```

**Future Benefit:** Next time a similar problem occurs, supervisor can:
1. Query RAG for similar past solutions
2. Reuse successful solutions instantly
3. No need to consult LLM again (faster + cheaper!)

## üìä API Reference

### Supervisor Methods

#### 1. Enable Learning

```python
supervisor.enable_learning(llm_client)
```

Enables learning capability with an LLM client.

**Parameters:**
- `llm_client`: LLM client (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

**Example:**
```python
from llm_client import get_llm_client

llm = get_llm_client(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o")
supervisor.enable_learning(llm)
```

---

#### 2. Handle Unexpected State

```python
result = supervisor.handle_unexpected_state(
    current_state="STAGE_STUCK",
    expected_states=["STAGE_RUNNING", "STAGE_COMPLETED"],
    context={
        "stage_name": "development",
        "error_message": "Agents deadlocked"
    },
    auto_learn=True  # Automatically learn and apply solution
)
```

**Returns:**
```python
{
    "unexpected_state": UnexpectedState(...),
    "solution": LearnedSolution(...),
    "success": True,
    "action": "learned_and_applied"
}
```

**Actions:**
- `"detected_only"` - Only detected, didn't learn
- `"learning_failed"` - Tried to learn but failed
- `"learned_and_applied"` - Learned solution and applied it

---

#### 3. Query Learned Solutions

```python
solutions = supervisor.query_learned_solutions(
    problem_description="developer agents stuck",
    top_k=3
)
```

Queries RAG for similar past solutions.

**Returns:** List of learned solutions from RAG

---

### Learning Engine Methods

#### 1. Detect Unexpected State

```python
unexpected = learning_engine.detect_unexpected_state(
    card_id="card-001",
    current_state="STAGE_TIMEOUT",
    expected_states=["STAGE_RUNNING", "STAGE_COMPLETED"],
    context={"stage_name": "testing", "timeout": 300}
)
```

**Returns:** `UnexpectedState` object or `None` if state is expected

---

#### 2. Learn Solution

```python
solution = learning_engine.learn_solution(
    unexpected_state,
    strategy=LearningStrategy.LLM_CONSULTATION
)
```

**Strategies:**
- `LLM_CONSULTATION` - Ask LLM for solution (default)
- `SIMILAR_CASE_ADAPTATION` - Adapt from similar past case
- `HUMAN_IN_LOOP` - Request human guidance
- `EXPERIMENTAL_TRIAL` - Try experimental solutions

---

#### 3. Apply Solution

```python
success = learning_engine.apply_learned_solution(
    solution,
    context={"card_id": "card-001"}
)
```

Executes the workflow steps and tracks success rate.

                stage_name=stage.name
            )

            # Check if state is expected
            current_state = self.state_machine.get_current_state()
